Simple Images Blocker With easy On Off button - chrome extension

It's difficult to read a large portion of text on a Web site that has images flashing and scrolling by. Luckily, Google Chrome offers a way to block individual sites from being able to load these images, keeping your reading environment distraction-free. with blocked images, the browser will load faster and will save on internet bandwidth usage. You can also focus more on the content of the writing so that you can take advantage of the information on the site. but it is quite a hassle if we want to display or block images any time we want. so I made a chrome extension to make it easier. You can turn images on or off with just one click without having to bother setting up in Chrome Browser.
